Program:  admit.py. 

Programmer: Omar Shatrat

Description:  The program compares two college applicants. The program should prompt for each studentâ€™s GPA, SAT, and ACT exam scores and report which candidate is more qualified on the basis of these scores.

This program compares two applicants to determine which one seems like the stronger applicant. 
For each candidate I will need either SAT or ACT scores as well as a weighted GPA.

Information for the first applicant:
	do you have 1) SAT scores or 2) ACT scores? 1
  SAT math? 510
  SAT verbal? 530
  overall GPA? 3.4
  max GPA? 4.0

Information for the second applicant:
	do you have 1) SAT scores or 2) ACT scores? 1
  SAT math? 570
  SAT verbal? 500
  overall GPA? 3.4
  max GPA? 4.0

First applicant overall score = 150.42
Second applicant overall score = 150.42
The two applicants seem to be equal
